        description: `This React student project was designed to provide hands-on practice with React Router DOM, a popular library used for adding routing functionality to React applications. The project involved creating multiple routes for the application and implementing navigation between them using the BrowserRouter component from React Router DOM.

        In addition to routing, the project also incorporated the use of the createContext API from React to create an authContext that was shared across the entire application. This allowed for easy management of user authentication and provided a seamless user experience.
        
        Throughout the development process, the project emphasized best practices in React development, including the use of functional components and hooks such as useState and useContext.
        
        Overall, this project served as a valuable learning experience for React students looking to gain practical experience with React Router DOM and other important React concepts.`,
        objective: `Provide practical experience in working with React Router DOM and the createContext API from React. By creating multiple routes and implementing a shared authContext, the project aimed to improve students' understanding of routing and state management in React applications`,
